          Wade Wilson's birthday celebrations go off without a hitch until the TVA steps in to interrupt them. Wade, better known by his stage name Deadpool, is captured and confronted with a sobering realization: his home reality, the Fox universe, is about to collapse, as revealed by the TVA's omniscient timekeepers. When the mysterious TVA agents give Wade a deadly ultimatum, he has to decide whether to accept the terrible fate that awaits his universe's destruction or to agree to be transported to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he may become a hero.

          Wade's determination wavers despite starting the transfer procedure as he considers how impossible it would be to protect his cherished friends and allies from the approaching obscurity. Driven by a sense of obligation and despair, Wade turns to Wolverine, another legendary character from the superhero canon, for assistance. Logan initially rejects Wade's requests and is skeptical, but after some convincing, Logan reluctantly cooperates.

Among these enemies are well-known villains like Magneto and The Juggernaut, strong opponents who increase the danger of their quest. Their quest takes on a deeply personal dimension when they learn that their families have been victims of the TVA's schemes. This realization strengthens their resolve to get past any challenges they face.
